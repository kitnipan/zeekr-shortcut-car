"""
Build the GitHub Release body for a given version.

Takes the matching section out of CHANGELOG.md so each release shows its own
changes instead of the same boilerplate every time, then appends the standing
safety / attribution text.

A stable version (no suffix) is introduced by its changelog section as a whole: that
section carries its own headings, written as ### in CHANGELOG.md and promoted to ## here.
Test builds (-alpha, -beta) list the section under "What changed".

Usage:  python3 .github/scripts/release_notes.py 0.3.0-alpha > RELEASE_NOTES.md
