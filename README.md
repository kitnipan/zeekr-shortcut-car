## What it does

App Lab gives a third-party app the four surround cameras as **one pre-stitched stream**: four
square views packed into a single frame, which previews as a distorted vertical strip. This app
splits it back into a 2×2 grid and builds on that. Chinese, English and Malay interface.

### Dash cam

- Records the surround view as a 2×2 grid, plus the front and rear cabin cameras if you turn them on.
- Three recording presets — save space (10 fps), balanced (20 fps), sharpest — each showing how
  many GB an hour it needs and how long your USB drive will last. Frame rate, bitrate, segment
  length and codec can also be tuned per camera.
- 1–10 minute segments. With a video storage cap set, the oldest unlocked clips are cleaned up when
  over the cap or low on space; with no cap, nothing is deleted and recording stops when space runs
  low.
- Photos use each camera's largest size.
- Records to a **USB drive only**. Writing to the head unit's built-in flash sits behind developer
  options, because that storage cannot be replaced once worn out.
- *Driving info bar* (experimental, off by default): turn signals, steering, gear, pedals, speed,
  lamps and more, recorded in a strip under the video.

On the main screen, tap any view to fill the preview with it and tap again to go back. The
**Straighten** button removes the fisheye bend, on the main screen and in playback. A floating
button shows whether recording is running and opens the app from anywhere.

### Super mirror

An electronic rear-view mirror: a floating, dockable window showing any one camera enlarged. Pinch
to zoom; swipe left or right to change camera; swipe up or down in the middle third to raise or
lower the framing. Or turn on *Button mode* and tap the top, bottom, left or right of the window to
switch camera. Push it half off-screen to hide it at the edge, and tap to bring it back. The
rear camera is mirrored, like a real mirror. Fisheye correction with an adjustable field of view is
optional.

### Playback

Video playback shows every camera together, in sync; tap one to enlarge it, tap again to go back.
Photo playback uses the same layout.

### Send to your phone

While viewing a photo or a video segment, tap **send to phone**: the app shows a QR code, your
phone's browser opens that file, and you save it. Nothing to install on the phone.

The file is served over your local network only while the dialog is open, from a random one-off
address, and only that one file. Both devices need to be on the same network — the easiest way is
to turn on the phone's hotspot and connect the car to it.

## Install

**Before you start:** you need to know how to sideload an app onto the head unit through App Lab.
This page does not cover that.

- **Recommended — the [latest stable release](../../releases/latest).**
- **Happy to try things early — the newest `-beta` on the [Releases](../../releases) page.** Or
  turn on *Include beta releases* under Settings → Check for updates and let the app fetch it.

Download the `ZeekrShortcut-*.apk` asset from the release page and sideload it through App Lab.
When the installer finishes, tap **Back** at the top left, not **Open**. Otherwise the head unit's
installer gets stuck and later installs or updates fail.

Building it yourself needs JDK 17+ and the Android SDK (compileSdk 36):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dts88/zeekr-shortcut-car.git
cd zeekr-shortcut-car && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The repo ships a public AOSP test signing key (password `android`). Override it with your own
through `ZEEKR_KEYSTORE`, `ZEEKR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ZEEKR_KEY_ALIAS` and `ZEEKR_KEY_PASSWORD`.

## Tips

### If the USB drive can't keep up

If recording stops working properly on the USB drive because the files have grown too large:

1. **Lower the frame rate to 10 fps first.** In **Settings → Recording → Edit stream profile**, tap
   each camera under *Cameras on* and set **Frame rate** to *10 fps (cap)*.
2. **Still not working? Then lower the bitrate** for those cameras.

Changes apply from the next recording.

A dash cam's main job is a clear picture. At 10 fps motion looks choppy, but each frame stays sharp.

For anything else, [open an issue](../../issues) and attach a report from **Settings → System →
Diagnostics**.

## Limitations

- Built for the ZEEKR 7X. Only the camera recognised as the composite stream is split; a head unit
  that does not provide one gets nothing split.
- Factory features come first: the built-in 360° view, reversing camera and parking cameras can
  reclaim a camera at any time.
- Starting on boot and recording on launch are off by default. Recording carries on with the
  screen off only while the car's Sentry Mode keeps the head unit awake.
- Cropping a surround view is switched off for now.
- On-vehicle validation is ongoing. Automated tests cover the pure logic only; test in a stationary
  vehicle first.

**GPL-3.0**, inherited from [EVCam](https://github.com/suyunkai/EVCam) by suyunkai — the code base
this app is forked from. The first commit in this repository is EVCam's complete working tree, so
every change since then is visible as a diff.

Splitting App Lab's composite stream into a grid and rendering it is implemented here from scratch.
